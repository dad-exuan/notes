## 项目管理简史
- 重点内容：
  - 项目管理到处都在并且由来已久。
  - 如果你保持初学者的头脑，你就有更多的学习机会。
  - 项目管理可以是工作、角色或活动。
  - 程序管理是微软强调定义的项目管理角色，它从矩阵组织结构中来。
  - 领导力需要对一些隽语的理解或直觉，包括自我/非自我、独裁/代理、鼓励/担心。
  - 小心自负和过度介入管理活动，你应该支持团队，而不是其他。
  - 如果你是专职的经理，从资产的角度来看团队和项目。

##	进度表的真相
- 重点内容：
  - 进度表有三个用途：承诺，鼓励成员对整体作贡献，跟踪进度。即使进度落后了，他们还是有价值的。
  - 大的进度表应该分成小的进度表，以最小化风险和增加调整的频度。
  - 所有的估算是概率。因为进度表是估算的集合，它们也是概率。进度的概率是相乘的（80% x 80% = 64%）。
  - 越早做估算越不准确。然后，大概的估算是更准确估算的起点。
  - 进度表应该以怀疑的态度来制定，而不是乐观的态度。花时间在设计上可以建立更可靠的自信心。

- It's only when the details are written down, with people's names next to them, that real calculations can be made and assumptions examined.
- give the team a tool to track progress and to break work into manageable chunks.
- Trimming from the design or testing time will only increase the odds that the time spent actually writing code will be misguided or will result in code that is harder to manage and maintain.
- create detailed schedules for limited periods of time only.
- Schedules demand that attention is paid to them as progress is made, and that adjustments are made as the project moves forward.
- Schedules need to be good enough for the team and the leaders to believe in, provide a basis for tracking and making adjustments, and have a probability of success that satisfies the client, the business, or the overall project sponsor.
- Often, QA has the best insight into design oversights and potential failure cases that others will overlook.
- Good estimates come from good designs. Good engineering estimates are possible only if you have two things: good information and good engineers.
- On occasion, obtaining multiple estimates (from two different developers) can be one way to do a sanity check.
- Estimates depend on the programmer's understanding of the project goals. 
- The most well-known technique is PERT
- the real schedule risks are the things not written down.


## 如何决定做什么
- 重点内容：
  - 不同的项目需要使用不同的计划方法。
  - 如何计划通常由谁有权力决定。需求、设计和预算是影响计划的三种项目权力。
  - 项目计划有些共同的制品：市场需求文档、远景/范围文档、规范书和WBS。
  - 项目计划最有力的方法涉及三方面：业务、技术和客户的视角。客户方面往往被误解和误用。
  - 提出问题能更好地思考，更有效地指导计划。
  - 问题描述和用例是定义和沟通需求的方法。他们能容易地转化成设计。

- The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build.
- Project planning involves answering two questions. Answering the first question, "What do we need to do?" is generally called requirements gathering. Answering the second question, "How will we do it?" is called designing or specifying 
- two perspectives on the project: business or engineering.
- there are four Ps that define marketing: product, price, placement, and promotion. 
- the greatest energy should be spent on understanding who those customers are. This includes studying what the customers do all day, how they currently do it, and what changes or improvements would be valuable in helping them do what they do.
- the customer point of view is built from two different sources: requests and research.
- 三方面的细节
  - Asking the right questions问题集
  - 常见的错误方法
  - 计划的过程

## 编写好的项目远景
- 重点内容：
  - 远景文档提取其他计划文档从而形成单一的高层计划。
  - 把事情写下来对作者和团队都有用。它提供了讨论和参考的切入点。
  - 远景文档内容的详细度因项目和团队而异。
  - 团队目标来自于远景中定义的目标。个人的目标来自于团队的目标。
  - 好的远景应该是简单、目标驱动、统一、有灵感和便于记忆的。
  - 量不代表质。简明扼要需要花费更多的时间。
  - 在日常决定中使用项目远景。

- One challenge in leading teams is keeping people focused on the same goals for long periods of time.
- One popular business acronym for writing good goals is SMART, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, and Timely. 
- ask how a project can still fail if its goal can be satisfied as written. 
- To help you figure out how much structure and investment your vision document needs, consider the following questions: +
- Key point to cover +
- Drafting, reviewing, and revising
- Visions should be visual
- The vision sanity check: daily worship + 几个问题

##	点子是哪里来的
- 重点内容：
  - 很多团队没有管理好需求和规范书的时间。
  - 质量需求和设计探索是最值得花时间的。
  - 点子的好坏仅仅相对于目标或其他点子。
  - 限制对产生点子是有用的，但是在限制之外考虑问题不是必要的。有时候最好的解决方法就是在限制之内找到一个解决方案。
  - 问题、透彻的看法、即兴发挥是找到新点子的工具。
  - 开始设计的最佳地方是用户体验。
  - 从点子到设计需要通过和不同专长的人交流。

- The less-than-surprising truth about the origins of ideas is that they come from people. 
- High-quality requirements are one option, and design exploration is the other.
- Requirements are critical. 
- everyone should be encouraged to ask questions and probe the requirements, which improves their quality.
- Notice that the requirement is specific about intention, but it is not specific about redesign for the page itself.
- Ideas look good or bad only against some kind of background, and no matter how smart or clever an idea seems in the abstract
- the real craft of problem solving and creative thinking is knowing which constraints to use or ignore and when to do so.
- Things often start with asking the right questions.
- Carefully asked questions are one way to lead difficult conversations in useful directions
- There are three kinds of questions to consider specific to creative problem solving: focusing questions (good), creative questions (also good), and rhetorical questions (evil).
- Great project managers and creative thinkers are masters of questions.
- the most powerful question：What problem are you trying to solve?
- Before any engineer thinks about how to build these things, someone has to consider the ideas' merits from the customer experience perspective.
- Good questions attract good ideas， 三类问题
- 5.6 产生ideas
- 5.7客户体验

##	如何处理点子
- 重点内容：
  - 点子有其要素，在创造性工作中它会你期望的更长的时间。项目中的变更会传递。
  - 对创造性工作建立检查点跟踪和管理它。通常的检查点包括概念验证、点子分类、3个可选方案、两个备选方案、最后设计。
  - 使用关系图巩固点子。
  - 原型是项目很早面对问题，在没有大风险时从错误中学习。
  - 采用迭代或从原型改进，提出问题、评估进度，决定下一步工作。
  - 创建一个未解决问题表用以跟踪在完成规范书前需要解决的问题。

- As hard as it is to find good ideas, it's even more difficult to manage them. 
- the time between the completion of early planning and the writing of specifications, in any milestone, is always tough
- to carefully manage the field of possible designs.
- one change can impact many different decisions
- the creative momentum of a project is always stronger than inexperienced leaders and managers expect.
- The best way to manage ideas is to start any major design work with clear checkpoints for how the time should be used.
- once you have enough ideas someone has to look at the possibilities and divide them into useful piles.
- to take an informal pass at prioritizing the ideas
- Prototypes are the natural next step in the design process.
- no matter how much it seems like people agree, if they're not all looking at the same image, they may not be agreeing at all. 
- If it's an early prototype, its next iteration might focus on exploring big ideas or wide changes. If it's a late prototype, iterations should be used to narrow the design space and help make decisions.
- As the field of alternatives narrows, there is one new responsibility for the project manager: the open-issues list.
- It should be the PM's job to make sure everyone is aware of issues they've been assigned, nag them appropriately, and track them to resolution.
- Typically, items that might block engineering but are not engineering specific such as marketing approval, usability considerations, branding, and visual design should be tracked by the project manager, as they will impact the specification more so than the implementation.
- The wise project manager divides the open-issues list into two priorities: things that need to be resolved before specifications, and things that might wait until later.
- 6.3 设计的checkpoint
- 6.4 点子的分类和优先级
- 6.5 利用原型
- 6.6 一些问题
- 6.7. The open-issues list

##	编写好的规范书
- 重点内容：
  - 规范书应该做三件事：确保做正确的产品，提供项目阶段的进度里程碑，能从不同人员得到深度的反馈。
  - 规范书仅解决部分问题。团队领导应该明白规范书要解决什么问题以及其他问题通过什么方法解决。
  - 好的规范书简单。他们主要是一种交流形式。
  - 写规范和设计很不同。
  - 谁来编写和控制规范必须有明确的职责。
  - 停止未解决问题的继续探讨是管理未解决问题和加快完成规范的一种方法。
  - 复查过程是定义和控制规范质量的最简单的方法。

- Specifications, like most things teams are asked to do, should match the needs of the current project and the people who will have to create and read them.
- There are four basic kinds of information that end up in specifications: Requirement, Feature, Work Item, Technical Spec
- At best, requirement is a list of victory conditions, describing what the end result will be, without explaining too much about how it will be achieved.
- The importance of a defined design process is to separate the act of designing and planning work from the act of writing a specification for it. The creation of a specification should, as much as possible, be focused on expressing an existing plan or set of decisions in the best possible way, rather than simultaneously designing that plan. 
- Whenever writing specifications (or anything else), it's important to remember that the way that we figured something out is not always the best way to explain it to someone else.
- Good specifications often describe the design in layers: first, what the customer experiences described in customer language; second, a high-level overview of basic objects and architecture; and third, coverage of complex and detailed engineering design issues.
- One of the best questions to ask people after they've read a specification is: "Do you have what you need to do your best work?" 
- Much like vision documents, it's very important that specifications have one author. the likely candidates for the job are the project manager, designer, or lead programmer
- There could be one single list of open issues at the end of the specification, which is the simplest solution
- For any development schedule that has a planning phase, the writing and reviewing of specifications is its natural conclusion.
- The biggest mistake people make with specifications is waiting until a formal review process takes place to get feedback on its contents.
- 7.1. What specifications can and cannot do
- 7.2 Requirement, Feature, Technical specs, work item list, test criteria and milestone exit
- 7.5. When are specs complete?
- 7.6.3. The list of review questions

##	如何做好的决定
- 重点内容：
  - 做决定或者花时间在哪个决定上有一个技巧。
  - 在花费许多时间前估量一下决定。
  - 有效地使用单一决定的机会。
  - 对值得更多投资的决定使用比较评估方法。
  - 任何决定都有情绪化的东西。
  - 比较评估法的最佳方法是优缺点表。这很容易请其他人加入、得到另外的视角。
  - 信息和数据不能为你做决定。
  - 通过复查以前的决定从中学习提高你的做决定能力。

- It's the ability to make effective decisions that explains how some people can manage five times as much work (or people) as others: they instinctively divide work into meaningful pieces, find the decisions and actions that have the most leverage, and invest their energy in making those decisions as good as possible.
- Klein identifies two basic ways people make decisions: singular evaluation and comparative evaluation
- making a short list of comparisons is a great way to check my own sanity. 
- The simplest way to do this is with a good old pros and cons list the best way to figure things out was to find the simplest explanation and use that first because, most of the time, it was the right explanation

##	沟通和人际关系
- 重点内容：
  - 项目只能通过沟通实现。在现代社会速度已经不是沟通的瓶颈，沟通质量成了瓶颈。
  - 人际关系可以促进沟通。
  - 人们如何沟通有几种模式。项目经理应该熟悉它们以解决沟通中存在的问题。
  - 沟通中有几个共同的问题，包括假设、不清晰、不倾听、听写、个人攻击、责怪。
  - 角色定义是促进关系的最简单方法。
  - 询问别人要将工作做得最好需要什么帮助，包括倾听、清除障碍、教他如何做和提醒他们目标。
  - 人际关系和沟通不是低优先级的工作，它们对项目的活动至关重要。

- 9.2. A basic model of communication
- 9.5. The best work attitude
- Most people educated in the Western world are taught to trust numbers.
- The best defense against data manipulation and misinterpretation is direct communication between people.
- Decision making is one of the most central things leaders and managers do, and the better the leader, the more courage that's required in the kinds of decisions that she makes 
- if you can't communicate, you can't succeed.
- First, the problem has become the quality and effectiveness of communication. Secondly, communication isn't enough: there need to be effective and healthy relationships between the people who are working together.
- communication and relationships are critical to success, and that there's room for improvement for yourself and your team. 
- A simple tactic for making the previous list actionable is to share it with people on your team, and ask them to identify when someone is behaving in a problematic way.
- you have to invest in relationships with people, regardless of how much they're investing in you.
- The easiest remedy is to clarify roles with any important person you know you will be working with: programmers, testers, marketers, clients, or even executives.
- manager should help each team member cultivate a desire for achievement. 
- Even if there are other demands on the PM's time, it's often best to prioritize assisting direct contributors to the project ahead of secondary political or bureaucratic matters. The former will always have a direct impact on the project schedule, but the later may not.
- Great leaders rarely force people to do anything.

##	如何不打扰别人：过程、email和会议
- 重点内容：
  - 项目经理容易打扰别人，有些是可以避免的。
  - 有多种原因人们会觉得受打扰了。通常，当他们感到时间被浪费了，自己被作为白痴对待或者他们被期望忍受单调乏味的事。
  - 好的流程有许多正面效果，包括加快过程和防止犯错。但是他们很难设计得好。
  - 好的email应该是简明和可以行动的，它让读者很快能知道读了标题和第一句后是否需要继续阅读。
  - 如果有人召集会议会开得好。
  - 当目标和会议的类型不匹配，会议就是让人沮丧的。

- 关于流程的处理
- 10.3.1. The good piece of email
- 会议及种类
- The three activities with the greatest odds of annoying people are email, meetings, and team processes 
- the processes can benefit everyone. Process can help people instead of restricting and annoying them.
- The trick in creating good processes is to understand two things in combination: what makes projects and teams successful in general, and what makes the current project and team different from others 
- The result is roughly this: process value = ((FC * FP) * T) - (DT + LT + (AT * N)).
- perhaps of most importance to project management: email is a primary means of communication for leaders and managers. 
- Smart managers value good email. 
- Interactive communication is always better at resolving confusion and conflict than email.
- The challenge is that whoever organizes and runs the meeting needs to know what he's doing.
- The most evil meetings occur when there is a mismatch of the goals and how they're organized. 
- The second most evil meeting is the one that recurs (weekly, daily, monthly), and then lives on for weeks despite it not being needed anymore
- Never let people leave a room without a clear plan for what the next step is.

##	出问题时怎么办
- 重点内容：
  - 无论你做什么，事情总会出错。
  - 如果你能保存冷静并将问题分解，你能处理许多困难情况(记住大致步骤)。
  - 有一些共同的情况，包括忽视、被要求做愚蠢的事、资源短缺、质量低下、方向改变、个人事务、阻力威胁。
  - 困境是学习的机会。确保你和你的团队花时间检查发生了什么问题以及如何可以避免它。
  - 无论是谁引起的问题，对任何情况负责，总是协助促进问题的解决。
  - 在极端情况下，进入破坏控制模式。做任何可以让项目进入一个已经并且稳定的状态。
  - 协商不仅在危机时刻有用，在管理中也有用。好的协商者从人们感兴趣的问题入手，而不是他们的位置。
  - 在任何时候有明确的职责分配。在危机发生时，人们要知道谁有绝对权。
  - 人们对压力的反应各不相同。要有敏锐的观察力，帮助团队对付各种压力。

- 11.1 处理过程
- 11.2 常见问题列表
- 11.4. Damage control
- In tough times, reconfirming your trust in someone's abilities might have more of a positive effect than any intellectual or technical contribution you could make
- from the first moment onward, your top priority is to return the project to an acceptable state.
- The important things then are how people treat each other when they disagree, how those disagreements are resolved, and whether disagreement and debate are converted into positive action.
- First, real trust is earned only when challenges surface and are overcome.
- Second, good teams function effectively because each individual understands his own role as well as the role of every other person on the team. 
- In tough times there needs to be a clear line of decision-making authority. 
- During difficult situations, one additional task for leaders is to make sure there is support for different kinds of stress relief. 
- Never let your team think that the need to release stress is a sign of weakness.
- The lesson here for PMs is that sometimes the emotions you receive from people you are working with will not be related directly to the actions you have taken.

##	为什么领导力来自信任
- 重点内容：
  - 信任建立自承诺。
  - 信任丢失于重要事情的言行不一。
  - 使用赋予的权力和信任使人们做好工作。
  - 赋予的权力来自组织结构。赢得的权力只能来自人们对你行动的反应。虽然都是必要的，赢得的权力更有用。
  - 通过代理在你的团队建立信任和确保远离灾难。
  - 对问题以一种能维持人们信任的方法处理。在危机时刻支持他们，使他们能将隐藏的问题提交给你。
  - 自信是领导力的核心。自省是一个方法。

- As a leader or significant contributor to a team, everything depends on what assumptions people can make of you. 
- Do what you say and say what you mean.
- Admit when you're wrong. 
- Enlist the opinions and ideas of others in decisions that impact them.
- A commitment, or promise, is the simplest kind of agreement between two people about something they both agree to do.
- Functional power comes in two flavors: granted and earned. 
- From an organizational standpoint, autocratic behavior pushes strong thinkers away. 
- If uncertainty is guaranteed, the project manager's best investment is likely to be having a strong network of trust between him and everyone who's contributing to the effort.
- they trust their own judgment enough to follow the same rules as everyone else 
- As a manager, I made a habit of asking people who reported to me, during weekly one-on-one meetings, if they had anything they wanted me to think about, regarding my work, my behavior, or my performance.
- The best leaders are the ones who take pleasure in the team being so committed to its intellectual standards that it's not afraid to question even the leader's behavior.
- Good management and leadership are about giving people as much responsibility and authority as their abilities and experience level allow, but somehow never letting them feel that they are working alone, or that they have your support only when things are going well.
- When there is a healthy system for recognizing, responding to, and learning from mistakes, over time fewer of them tend to happen
- The worst thing in the world, especially during a crisis, is for a manager or leader to reprimand someone while the issue is still unresolved.

##	如何使事情发生
- 重点内容：
  - 任何事情都可以用排序表表示。多数项目管理的工作是正确排定优先级然后领导团队实施的。
  - 最重要的三张优先级表是：目标（远景）、特性和工作单。他们应该总是相互同步的，每个工作对应一个特性，每个特性对应一个目标。
  - 在第一档优先级和其他工作间应该有一条黄色线条。
  - 当你拒绝时事情就能进展。如果你不能拒绝，你肯定没有优先级。
  - 项目经理应该让团队诚实，并和现实情况靠拢。
  - 在工程和过程中了解关键路径能提高效率。
  - 为了有进展，你必须是冷酷和有悟性的。

- An ordered list is just a column of things, put in order of importance.
- having clear priorities was the backbone of progress. 
- For most projects, the three most important and most formal ordered lists are used to prioritize project goals, features, and work items 
- Other important things that might need ordered lists include bugs, customer suggestions, employee bonuses, and team budgets.
- If you do use the three most common ordered lists, make sure that they always map to each other. 
- Clarity is how you make things happen on projects. 
- They had an ordered list in their heads and were able to get other people to frame the discussion around it. Good priorities are power.
- a fundamental law of the PM universe is this: if you can't say no, you can't manage a project.
- As a rule, the further a team gets from reality, the harder it is to make good things happen.
- The more you can keep the truth out in the open, the more your team can stay low to the ground, moving at high speed.
- If done properly, this diagram shows where the bottlenecks will be.
- Often the best way of improving critical paths in organizations is to remove processes and shift authority down and across a team, instead of creating new processes or hierarchies.
- It's often the PM who has to question people, challenge assumptions, and seek the truth, regardless of how uncomfortable it might make others (although the goal is to do this in a way that makes them as comfortable as possible). PMs have to be willing to do these things when necessary.
- Effective PMs simply consider more alternatives before giving up than other people do.
- Be relentless in spirit, but clever and savvy in action. 
- PMs must pay attention to the different social, political, and organizational environments they are in, and use the right approaches for where they are.
- Being savvy means you are looking for, and willing to take, the smarter route.

##	项目中期策略
- 重点内容：
  - 中期和晚期对应项目的中期和晚期。
  - 如果有一天项目有了问题，这是你的职责找出问题原因并解决它。在项目中期持续这样做。
  - 项目是复杂的非线性系统，有它的惯性。如果在你采取行动前等着看问题，你可能太晚了，事情变得更糟了。
  - 当你的项目失去控制时，说明你是在机舱后面飞行了。健全性检查是一种最简单的方法，包括策略和战略检查。
  - 考虑采用最安全的方法来纠正情况。动作越大，项目越深入，危险越大。
  - 代码流水线是实现阶段管理工作的方法。管理流水线有进取心的和保守的方法。
  - 基于里程碑的计划和代码流水线提供了项目安全的计划。
  - 变更控制是你控制中低级变化的方法。

- Good project management, then, is largely about staying one or two steps ahead of the project, investing whatever energy is necessary to avoid getting into these situations in the first place.
- The warning is this: even with a stable but high-speed project, the complex nature of both the code base and the team means any management action may have unexpected consequences. 
- For project managers, the most effective way to fly in front of the plane is having a daily sanity check. 
- There are three ways to do this: tactical questions, strategic questions, and transparent progress measures for the team.
- The goal of any PM must be to take safe action. 
- One integral part of safe action is considering the commitments team leaders have made to the team.
- The pragmatic view of mid-game work focuses on programmers writing code.
- Nothing is more important than resolving an issue that blocks a programmer.
- The longer the team waits to make changes while the project is in motion, the larger the costs will tend to be.
- The more mature a team is, the earlier it will tend to want to control change. 
- it's better to use short dev cycles with strong design processes and allow few DCRs, than to plan a schedule that expects many DCR changes.
- work items are the most important tracking mechanism for mid-game.

##	项目晚期策略
- 重点内容：
  - 大的期限是一系列小的期限。
  - 任何里程碑有三个小的期限：设计完成（规范书），特性（实现）完成和里程碑（QA和改进）结束。
  - 在里程碑前定义结束标准能提高团队如期完成的能力。
  - 如期完成就像飞机降落：你需要一个长而缓的过程。并且你需要准备不经重大维修而马上重新起飞。
  - 你需要跟踪项目的度量，通常包括：每日构建，Bug管理和活动表。
  - 你需要项目级的控制手段，包括复查会议、筛选和战时团队。
  - 项目晚期的结束是一个缓慢而让人麻木的过程。其挑战是控制修改的范围直到有一个满意的版本。
  - 现在是开始后期工作的过程了。给你自己和团队一个学习什么做的好什么不好的机会。
  - 如果幸运，项目可以出品了，庆祝一下。

- if you require extraordinary efforts to meet a date, realize you are stealing those efforts from the early parts of the next phase.
- the simplest rule of thumb for hitting dates is that the better your exit criteria, the better your chances are
- All things being equal, people will tend to avoid doing things they don't want to do
- If your approach is too conservative, the worst that can happen is that you'll finish ahead of schedule, whereas if you're too aggressive, all sorts of evil things will happen.
- Tracking progress becomes very important in both mid-game and end-game. 
- By making builds of the project each day, you force many kinds of issues to be dealt with in the present, instead of postponing them into the future. 
- The system used to track bugs can be simple, but there must be one, and everyone must use it. 
- Get into the habit of asking "What's the bug number for that?" whenever issues come up.
- A basic bug activity chart
- The most important way to think about the different elements of control is how often they are applied. 
- A review is when the team leaders must present the state of their project, compared against goals, to senior management, clients, and the entire team itself.
- Any process where you take a list of issues and put them in order of priority is a triage process.
- As a project nears completion, the distribution of authority has to centralize. War team agenda is decided each morning, and any issue can be placed on the agenda.
- In general, the fewer issues war team needs to manage, the better the job senior management has done in planning, executing, and leading the team through the project.
  
##	权利和政治
- 重点内容：
  - 政治是人的天性。人们一起工作而权力有限，它必须分布于不同的人。
  - 任何领导都受限制。一般的，一个人越有权力，他受的限制就更复杂。
  - 有多种政治权力，包括奖励、高压、知识、影响力。
  - 如果没有用在实现项目目标，权力就被滥用了。没有明确的目标、资源分配不清、决策过程不清或者误解都会导致权力滥用。
  - 为了解决政治问题，明确你需要的资源。明确谁有你要的，然后如何才能得到它。

- Misuse of power then occurs when an individual is working toward his own interests. 
- The best way to reduce these symptoms is to depend heavily on the goals defined by the project vision to drive the application of power. 
- The only way to be successful in resolving a political problem is to be very clear on what it is you need, and then develop a plan to get it. 
- The best possible time to do this kind of political needs analysis is at the moment when your goals are defined.
