## How to Build a High Velocity Development Team

* Introduction
  * There’s just one problem: Your organization is afraid of change. Fear is the enemy of velocity. 
  * This should be your priority number one until nobody in your organization worries about changing a line of source code again
  * Organizational transformation requires education and coordination of both the engineering teams and the managers who lead them

* Team Building & Morale
  * > “People, process, product.” ~ Marcus Lemonis
  * Most tech teams fail because most tech teams don’t understand how to hire and motivate developers

* The Biggest Mistake Almost All Teams Make
  * Ticket trackers tell you about the project, not the people
  * Your best developers spend disproportionately more time helping other developers perform at their peak

* High Velocity Development
  * Ideal agility 
    * Bugs in live code get fixed in the live product within 24 hours with near zero risk
    * Almost all bugs get caught before they have a chance to annoy users
    * New features can be toggled on and off, safely tested, and gradually rolled out, all in production
    * All changes to production code get rolled out while key business metrics are tracked in realtime
  * Your team needs to write automated tests for every feature and every bug fix, because automated QA is a foundation of continuous delivery
  
* Architect for Change & Growth
  * Developers write code on a single machine, scale is invisible to them
  * Decoupled, distributed architectures make reliability a core feature
  * Before you build, plan to grow

* Language Matters
  * JavaScript is the standard language of the web platform, and your app should be written in JavaScript on both the client and the server side

* Classical Inheritance is Obsolete

* Encourage Collaboration
  * Code reviews and occasional pair programming are great practices
  * A culture full of collaboration and mentorship is capable of very rapid progress
  * People learn rapidly when they’re given a challenge and the opportunity to collaborate freely on the solution 

* Open Source All Your Modules by Default

* Embrace Remote Culture
