## How to be better mentors

### Introduction
* Practicing mindfulness — being patient, focused on the moment, and accepting of events as they unfold — is important
* Please refer to the [original article](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-doctors-can-be-better-mentors)

### Be available
  * Appreciate that some is better than none
  * Find alternatives to the face-to-face meeting
  * Be fully present
### Know your role
  * The “coach” teaches the junior person how to improve in a particular skill
  * The “sponsor” helps boost mentees by promoting them for specific awards or positions
  * The “connector” serves as a master networker 
### Try to be objective
  * Mindfulness requires being non-judgmental and supportive
  * We focus on remaining objective during the interaction
  * mindfully withholding immediately judgement and emotions is best for all involved.
### Put yourself in their shoes
  * This has made us more empathetic and compassionate in our roles as mentors
