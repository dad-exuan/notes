## How to explain something so that everyone understands

* "Adult learners come to each learning experience with their unique former knowledge," write Harold D. Stolovitch and Erica J. Keeps in their book, Telling Ain't Training. For that reason, "the more you factor the experience of your learners into the design and delivery" of your presentation, training or other communication, "the more effective the outcome."
* Suggestions:
  1. Use familiar vocabulary, language style, examples and references
  2. Draw examples and experiences from the group to "enrich the session and build bridges from the familiar to the new." 
  3. "Innoculate" your learners.
* By meeting people where they are and acknowledging their experience, you can explain your topic so that everyone understands it.
